<h1>Task 3 Explanation </h1>

<p>
  in line 2, I declared "count" variable
  in "increment" function, I increase count by 1
  in line 7, I declared another variable for print the message
  and in "log" function, we print the message once
  
  after all calls we got output, which is 0.
  because when we increment of count, we are not printing message in increment function.
  so the message is print only once, which is 0.
